        <p id="para1">Bibo the cat was about 4 weeks old when he was rescued
            and taken in by the Ndeki family. It is difficult to 
            trace his origin but the speculation is that the parents 
            mus have been strays as well.
            Nonetheless Bibo the Cat has a new loving home.

            <h2 class="highlight">Why Bibo</h2>
                <p>Bibo has been named after no one in
                    particular so Bibo it is.
                </p>
        <h1> Home life</h1>
                <p>Bibo just sleeps and naps all day 
                    the cute thing doesn't even know what taxes are.
                </p>
        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p>Bibo is yet to give a statement as he is playing with
            a ball of yarn.
